Rules:
Rules are like in the classical Tetris. Your goal is to collect the highest possible score.
You are getting points for removing fully filled lines.
More lines you remove at the same time the bigger reward you get.

for 1 line = 100 points
for 2 line = 400 points
for 3 line = 900 points

Each time you remove lines, the pieces starts to fall faster.
If a piece reaches the top of the screen, you lose.
